Problem Statement
As a data scientist at Car Dheko, your goal is to improve customer experience by building a machine learning model that accurately predicts the prices of used cars. The project involves creating a web-based application using Streamlit to allow users to input car details and receive price predictions in real time.

Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict used car prices based on various car features.
Integrate the model into a Streamlit application for real-time predictions.
Data Source
The dataset is collected from CarDekho, which includes detailed information about used cars from multiple cities. Each city has its own Excel file containing car features, specifications, and available features.

Project Scope
Data Processing

Import and Concatenate: Import datasets from different cities, convert unstructured data into a structured format, and concatenate them into a single dataset with an additional 'City' column.
Handling Missing Values: Use imputation techniques (mean, median, mode) for numerical columns and mode or a new category for categorical columns.
Standardizing Data Formats: Ensure consistent data types (e.g., removing units like 'kms' from numerical columns).
Encoding Categorical Variables: Apply one-hot encoding for nominal categories and label encoding for ordinal categories.
Normalizing Numerical Features: Apply Min-Max or Standard scaling for numerical columns.
Removing Outliers: Use IQR or Z-score analysis to handle outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) to understand data distribution.
Visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps) to identify patterns and correlations.
Feature selection using correlation analysis and feature importance.
Model Development

Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets (70-30 or 80-20).
Model Selection: Evaluate different models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting).
Model Training: Train models and use cross-validation to ensure robust performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using Grid Search or Random Search.
Model Evaluation

Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
Compare models and select the best-performing one.
Optimization

Feature engineering to create new features or modify existing ones.
Apply regularization (Lasso, Ridge) to prevent overfitting.
Deployment

Deploy the model using Streamlit to create a user-friendly web app.
Allow users to input car features and get real-time price predictions.
Results
A functional and accurate machine learning model for predicting used car prices.
Comprehensive analysis and visualizations based on the dataset.
Interactive Streamlit web application for real-time price prediction.
Detailed documentation explaining the methodology, models, and results.
